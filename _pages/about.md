This is a placeholder biography. I am a theoretical astrophysics PhD student at MSSL. My research interests are in QED, neutron stars, accretion, high performance computing. I like writing software, hiking, and bouldering. 

I would like to see more open source collaboration on code in science. I think it would be an amazing benefit to all of us. 

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
